what is the definition of valid IP
1）The length of the ip without '.' should be equal to the length of s
2）The digit order of ip should be same as the digit order of s;
3）Each part separated by the '.' should not start with '0' except only '0'
4）Each part separared by the '.' should not larger than 255

前两条不太懂
把数字分成任意四部分，每一部分s均须满足：
  1）0<s.lenth<=3
  2)s.val<=255
  3)if s.lenth>1 则s[0]！=0

失败+1 搞不懂有效地址是什么
question:
Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.
Example:
Input: "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]

my answer:
